# UFO Sightings
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to explore incidents of UFO Sightings. This is done by creating a website that allows the user to look through data displayed in a table, and apply filters for a deeper analysis.

The user is able to filter by:
- Date of Incident
- City
- State
- Country
- Shape (of sighting)

## Resources
- Data Source: data.js
- Software: Javascript, D3, Bootstrap v4

# Results
## Design
Below, is a screenshot of the design of the website. The website is divided into two sections, with the first being an article written to grab the user's attention and get them interested in searching through the database. The second section is subdivided into two more sections, one with the form to filter the data, and the second being the actual table filled with the filtered data.

## How to Perform a Search
To filter the data, the user would have to add one of the fields in the form to the left, such as the example below for the shape of the sighting. This will then automatically filter the data to only include the sightings with that specific shape.

# Summary
## Drawbacks
The filters in the form are case sensitive, requiring the user to enter the filter exactly the same as it is written in the data table.

## Additional Recommendations
- Adding page buttons to move between data, instead of scrolling down all the way. Will help with larger datasets.
- Add a sorting functionality to the columns.
